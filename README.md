## 💡 My Projects

### 📦 1. Building an Object Detection App with TensorFlow.js and React.js using COCO-SSD

**🔗 Based on:** [Unit 2 – Get Started with Object Detection](https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/get-started-object-detection?hl=en)

A real-time web application that uses **TensorFlow.js** and **React.js** to detect multiple objects in webcam feed or static images using the **COCO-SSD** pre-trained model. Fully runs in the browser with no backend.

**Features:**
- Real-time object detection via webcam
- Browser-based TensorFlow.js model execution
- Clean React.js UI with bounding box overlays
- Uses the COCO-SSD model (80 common object classes)

> ✅ *Status: Completed*

### 🧠 2. Recyclable vs Non-Recyclable Classifier (Python)

**🔗 Based on:** [Unit 6 – Going Further with Image Classification](https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/going-further-image-classification?hl=en)

This project is a custom image classifier that detects whether an item belongs to the **recyclable** or **non-recyclable** category. Built using Python and TensorFlow, it promotes eco-friendly practices by assisting in waste categorization.

**Features:**
- Binary classification using a trained image model
- Clean UI for testing with user-uploaded images
- Accurate and fast predictions on custom dataset

> ✅ *Status: Completed*
