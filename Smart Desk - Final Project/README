🧠 3. Smart Desk Final Project (Python)

🔗 Based on: Entire Virtual Internship

This all-in-one Smart Desk Classifier project was developed during the Google AI/ML Virtual Internship – Cohort 12, organized by AICTE and Google Developers. It combines:

🔍 Object Detection: Identifying desk items in real time
♻ Image Classification: Determining recyclability of uploaded images
Both modules are powered by Python and built upon Google’s pathway units for Object Detection (Unit 2) and Image Classification (Unit 6).

Features :

Binary classification using a trained image model
Clean UI for testing with user-uploaded images
Accurate and fast predictions on custom dataset


🛠️ Tech Stack :


Python
TensorFlow (v2+)
OpenCV, NumPy
Streamlit (web UI)
Pre-trained COCO-SSD model
Custom CNN model (recycle_classifier.h5)


🎯 Key Features :
🔍 Object Detection
Real-time detection of common desk items: laptop, pen, bottle, etc.
Utilizes a pre-trained COCO-SSD model for bounding box visualization.
Runs on webcam input or static images.
♻ Image Classification
Accepts user-uploaded waste images via browser UI.
Classifies into 7 categories, then maps to Recyclable or Non‑Recyclable.
Provides quick and accurate classification results.


🧑‍💻 Setup & Usage
